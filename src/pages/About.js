            Come with me on a journey while I build this blog to include in my portfolio. I will be adding new features and functionality as we continue along. I will be using React, React Router, React Bootstrap, and Firebase for the front-end, and Node.js, Express, MongoDB Atlas and Firebase for the back-end. I will also be using React Context API for state management, and React Hooks for functional components. I will be using React Router for routing, and React Bootstrap for styling. I will be using Firebase for authentication, and Firestore for the database. I will be using Firebase Storage for storing images, and Firebase Hosting for hosting the application. I will be using React Toastify for displaying toast messages, and React Tag Input for tags. I will be using React Paginate for pagination, and React Helmet for SEO. I will be using React Quill for the text editor, and React Icons for icons. I will be using React Share for social media sharing, and React Chartjs for charts.
